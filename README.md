# Projet Final

Project developed in ASP.NET MVC for a wood craftsman's online store.

## Description

Mr. Larmoire is a cabinetmaker in Normandy, northern France. He creates, renovates and manufactures furniture and decorative elements: tables, doors, cupboards, chairs, friezes and sculptures in solid wood, which he makes to measure.

He would like to promote his creations and is considering creating a website to showcase them. He doesn't have a website at all at the moment, and has no expertise in the field.
